## Why do I need vRAM?

RAM is a memory device used to store smart contract data on EOS. However, its limited capacity makes it difficult to build and scale dApps. vRAM provides dApp developers with an efficient and affordable alternative for their data storage needs.

## How is vRAM different from RAM?

vRAM is a complement to RAM. It is an alternative storage solution for developers building EOS dApps that are RAM-compatible, decentralized, and enables storing & retrieving of potentially unlimited amounts of data affordably and efficiently. It allows dApp developers to cache all relevant data in RAM to distributed file storage systems (IPFS, BitTorent, HODLONG) hosted by DAPP Service Providers (DSPs), utilizing RAM to store only the data currently in use. vRAM transactions are still stored in chain history and so are replayable even if all DSPs go offline.

## How can we be sure that data cached with DSPs is not tampered with?

DSPs cache files on IPFS, a decentralized file-storage system that uses a hash function to ensure the integrity of the data. You can learn more about IPFS here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=8CMxDNuuAiQ

## How much does vRAM cost?

Developers who wish to use the vRAM System do so by staking DAPP tokens to their chosen DSP for the amount specified by the Service Package they've chosen based on their needs. By staking DAPP, they receive access to the DSP services, vRAM included.
